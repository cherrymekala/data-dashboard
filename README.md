CO2 Emissions Visualization
Built a python application to visualize global CO2 emissions data using 
an interactive web-based interface. It leverages the Taipy GUI framework to 
create a dynamic and responsive app that displays CO2 emissions across different 
countries and years through a choropleth map and accompanying data tables.
